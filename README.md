# Kubernetes (K3s) Architecture Guide

Welcome to the Kubernetes (K3s) Architecture Guide! This repository aims to provide clear explanations and diagrams of the core components that make up a Kubernetes cluster, with a focus on K3s implementations.

Whether you're setting up your first cluster, troubleshooting issues, or simply looking to deepen your understanding, this guide will walk you through the essential elements of both the Control Plane (Master) and Worker nodes.

## Architecture Overview

Kubernetes operates on a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the Control Plane (often referred to as the Master node) and the Worker Nodes.
